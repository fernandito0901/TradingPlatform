# Planning Notes - 2025-07-26

## Status
The collector package now supports argument parsing, logging and a CI workflow. Basic
fetch functions are covered by unit tests. Documentation still lacks a dedicated
section describing environment variables.

## Next Goals
1. **Environment Variable Docs** – Expand `README.md` with a section detailing
   `POLYGON_API_KEY` usage and examples for log configuration.
2. **WebSocket Tests** – Create tests for `stream.stream_quotes` using a mocked
   WebSocket server to ensure reconnect behaviour when real-time feed is
   unauthorized.
3. **HTTP Caching** – Implement a simple caching layer for `rate_limited_get`
   to avoid repeated requests during the same run. Configurable TTL via env var.
4. **News Data Collection** – Extend `collector.api` to fetch recent news via
   NewsAPI and store results under `news` table. Document schema in `db.py`.

These objectives will feed into feature engineering and playbook generation.
