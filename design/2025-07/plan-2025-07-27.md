# Planning Notes - 2025-07-27

## Vision
With data collection in place, the next milestone is generating predictive features and a basic model so downstream agents can produce the daily options playbook.

## Proposed Tasks
1. **Feature Engineering Pipeline** – Create `features/` module to compute technical indicators (SMA, RSI) and join fundamentals. Output `features/{date}/features.csv`.
2. **Model Training** – Train a baseline LightGBM classifier using the engineered features and store under `models/`. Log AUC/accuracy in `NOTES.md`.
3. **Playbook Generation** – Implement `playbook/` package that loads model predictions and selects top trades using the scoring rule. Output JSON playbook to `playbooks/{date}.json`.

These tasks will introduce new directories for features, models and playbooks. Each step should include unit tests and documentation.
