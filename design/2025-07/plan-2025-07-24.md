# Planning Notes - 2025-07-24

## Objectives
- Kick off implementation of existing tasks starting with API key security and modularization.
- Introduce packaging metadata so the collector can be installed as a CLI tool.

## Proposed Tasks
1. Add `pyproject.toml` with basic project metadata and entry point for `collector.main`.
2. Document environment variable configuration for `POLYGON_API_KEY` and logging path.
3. Plan incremental extraction of functions into the `collector` package.
4. Ensure tests and CI run for every module as it is created.

These notes set the direction for the next development cycle.
