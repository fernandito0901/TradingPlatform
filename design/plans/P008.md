# Planning Notes - P008

## Strategy Dashboard and Alerting

The next milestone focuses on surfacing strategy recommendations and notifying users about impactful trades or news. We'll build a simple dashboard and extend the alerting system.

### Goals
1. Display available option strategies with estimated POP and max risk.
2. Enable execution of simulated trades via a broker API stub.
3. Aggregate trade flow and news alerts, sending batches to Slack.
4. Track open positions and realized PnL for paper trading.

### Tasks
- **T58** – @Synthesizer builds `reports/strategies.html` with interactive POP charts and buy/sell actions.
- **T59** – @DataCollector detects large trades & breaking news; send Slack alerts in real time.
- **T60** – @Reviewer documents how to generate strategies, use the dashboard, and configure alerts.
- **T63** – @Synthesizer extends `Config` with `max_risk` per strategy including tests.
- **T64** – @DataCollector implements an alert aggregator batching messages to Slack.
- **T65** – @Coder creates a broker API stub so dashboard actions place simulated orders.
- **T66** – @Planner designs a portfolio tracker storing open positions and daily PnL.

These features move the project toward an end-to-end trading assistant capable of risk-managed paper trading.
