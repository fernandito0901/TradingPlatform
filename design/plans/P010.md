# Planning Notes - P010

## Portfolio Tracker Design

To support paper trading and risk monitoring, we need a persistent tracker for open positions and PnL history. This tracker will integrate with the simulator and dashboards.

### Goals
1. Record each simulated trade with quantity, price, and strategy metadata.
2. Persist current positions in `portfolio.csv` and update after each trade.
3. Log daily realized and unrealized PnL in `pnl.csv` for reporting.
4. Expose CLI commands to show open positions and close them.

### Proposed Schema
`portfolio.csv` columns:
`symbol`, `strategy`, `qty`, `avg_price`, `opened_at`.

`pnl.csv` columns:
`date`, `symbol`, `unrealized`, `realized`, `total`.

### Tasks
- **T73** – @Planner finalize schema for `portfolio.csv` and `pnl.csv` with column descriptions.
- **T74** – @Coder implement `portfolio` module with load/save helpers and CLI commands.
- **T75** – @Synthesizer integrate portfolio updates into the simulator and dashboards.
- **T76** – @Tester create tests covering trade recording and PnL calculations.
