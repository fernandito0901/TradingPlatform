# Planning Notes - P014

## Position Evaluator and Exit Simulation

To complete the real-time management workflow, we need to evaluate open
positions continuously and track hypothetical exit PnL. This will allow
risk-aware alerts and performance monitoring.

### Goals
1. Evaluate stop-loss and take-profit rules for each open position.
2. Simulate exits using the latest quotes to update running PnL.
3. Provide a CLI command to run the evaluator loop and record results.

### Tasks
- **T88** – @Coder build evaluation engine computing exit signals and updating tracker.
- **T90** – @Modeler design exit simulation algorithm updating PnL.
- **T93** – @Coder implement CLI `evaluator.py` running the evaluation loop.
- **T94** – @Tester add tests verifying exit signals and simulation outputs.
- **T95** – @Reviewer document evaluator usage and exit workflow in README.
