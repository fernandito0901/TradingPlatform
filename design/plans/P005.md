# Planning Notes - P005

## Options Strategies and Alerts

This plan outlines the work required to introduce basic option strategies and monitoring tools.

### 1. Strategy Primitives (T57)
Modeler will implement a `strategies.py` module defining payoff calculations for iron condors and call debit spreads. Unit tests should verify profit/loss at expiration given sample option legs.

### 2. Strategy Dashboard (T58)
Synthesizer will create `reports/strategies.html` summarizing available strategies. The dashboard must list suggested strikes/expirations with buttons or CLI commands to buy/sell and show probability of profit (POP) for each trade.

### 3. Real-time Alerts (T59)
DataCollector will extend the async streaming utilities to detect unusually large trades and fetch breaking news headlines. Alerts should be sent via Slack or printed during `run_daily`.

### 4. Documentation (T60)
Reviewer will update the README to describe how to generate strategies, view the dashboard, and configure alerts.

These tasks will expand the platform beyond single-leg trades and make it responsive to market-moving events.
