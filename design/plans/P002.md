# Planning Notes - P002

## Next Feature Milestones

1. **Async Collector API (T47)**
   - Implement `collector/api_async.py` using `aiohttp` for concurrent data pulls.
   - Update fetch functions and tests to use the async client when enabled.

2. **Crossâ€‘Validation Training (T48)**
   - Extend `models.train` with a 5-fold cross-validation option.
   - Return mean AUC and log per-fold metrics in `reports/dashboard.html`.

3. **Interactive Feature Dashboard (T49)**
   - Build a Plotly-based report `reports/feature_dashboard.html` showing feature distributions and correlations.
   - Link the dashboard in the README under Reports.

4. **Environment File Loader (T50)**
   - Create a helper `load_env()` to read environment variables from `.env` if present.
   - All entry points should call this at startup so secrets can be managed locally.

These tasks will improve pipeline performance and usability.
