# Planning Notes - 2025-08-03

## Idea
We want a simple way for users to verify their API keys and connectivity. We'll design a new `collector.verify` module that calls a subset of data-fetch functions for a few tickers, printing success counts. This acts as a quick smoke test.

## Proposed Command
- `python -m collector.verify --polygon-key KEY --news-key KEY --symbols AAPL,MSFT,GOOG,TSLA,AMZN`
- Uses in-memory SQLite via `db.init_db(':memory:')`.
- Calls `fetch_ohlcv` and `fetch_option_chain` for each symbol.
- Prints number of bars and options retrieved per symbol.
- Exits 0 on success or non-zero on API errors.

## Benefits
- Allows new users to validate their keys without running full pipeline.
- Keeps API keys off disk by accepting them via CLI and setting env vars during execution.
