# Planning Notes - P004

## Unified Configuration System

To simplify CLI and environment variable management, we will introduce a `Config` dataclass.
This object will merge `.env` values with command-line flags so modules can depend on a single
source of truth.

### Proposed Tasks

1. **Design Config Dataclass (T54)**
   - Fields: `symbols`, `db_file`, `use_async`, `log_file`, `log_level` and relevant API keys.
   - Provide a helper `load_config()` that reads `.env` and parses CLI args.
   - Document the dataclass structure in design docs.

2. **Refactor Entry Points (T55)**
   - Update `run_daily`, `market_data_collector`, and other scripts to accept a `Config` object.
   - Adjust tests to pass the dataclass rather than individual args.

3. **Update Documentation (T56)**
   - README should describe the new configuration workflow and sample `.env` file.
   - Mention the unified `Config` in the usage examples.

These tasks will close the remaining open item T53 and make future options easier to manage.
