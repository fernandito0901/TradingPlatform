# Planning Notes - 2025-08-11

## Reconsidering Plan Organization
- Monthly folders helped but dates are still awkward and cause duplication.
- We'll migrate to numbered plans under `design/plans/` and keep a single archive for old notes.

## Action Items
1. **Consolidate historical plans (T44)** – Summarize existing dated notes into `planning/archive.md` and remove the originals.
2. **Adopt numbered planning docs (T45)** – Create `design/plans/P001.md` onward with an accompanying index file.
3. **Refresh references (T46)** – Update PLAN_INDEX, README, and automation tasks to reflect the numbered structure.
