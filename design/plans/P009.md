# Planning Notes - P009

## Web Dashboard Expansion

The project now includes a minimal Flask webapp exposing the daily pipeline and connectivity check. To make the platform easier for end users we should expand this interface so all commands can be run from the browser and configuration is collected automatically on first launch.

### Goals
1. On first visit, display a setup form requesting API keys (Polygon, News, Slack) and any default symbols. Save values to `.env` for future runs.
2. Provide buttons for common tasks: run daily pipeline, verify connectivity, backfill data, run simulations, and generate dashboards.
3. Show links to generated reports and a table of recent scoreboard entries so results are easy to view.

### Tasks
- **T68** – @Planner designs full web dashboard layout and configuration workflow.
- **T69** – @Coder implements the expanded `webapp` with routes for pipeline, backfill, simulation, and report viewing. Config values from setup page are stored to `.env`.
- **T70** – @Synthesizer integrates scoreboard and strategy/feature dashboards into the web interface.
- **T71** – @Reviewer documents web usage in the README with screenshots or examples.
- **T72** – @Tester adds tests covering the new web routes and setup flow.
