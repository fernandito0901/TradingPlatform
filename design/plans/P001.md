# Planning Notes - P001

## Plan Index Automation and Slack Alerts Recap
- Implemented `gen_plan_index.py` to rebuild `PLAN_INDEX.md`.
- Slack notifications now report pipeline success or failure.
- Historical backfill and data quality scripts added.

## Upcoming Documentation Restructure
1. **Versioned architecture docs (T43)**
   - Move `architecture-*.md` files into `design/architecture/`.
   - Create an `architecture/ARCH_INDEX.md` linking to each file.
   - Update references in other docs and PLAN_INDEX.

2. **Consolidate historical plans (T44)**
   - Summarize existing dated plans under `planning/archive.md`.
   - Remove the individual monthly files after archiving.

3. **Adopt numbered plan docs (T45)**
   - New plans will be stored in `design/plans/` as `P001.md`, `P002.md`, ...
   - Update `gen_plan_index.py` to scan the numbered files as well.

4. **Update references (T46)**
   - README and automation scripts should use the new numbered paths.

These tasks will keep the documentation maintainable as the project grows.
