# Planning Notes - P006

## Strategy Simulation and POP Engine

Following the basic strategy and alert framework, we need tools to evaluate and execute trades.

### 1. Probability-of-Profit Estimator (T61)
Modeler will implement `strategies.pop` providing analytic or Monte Carlo POP calculations for option positions. Tests must verify values are between 0 and 1 for sample trades.

### 2. Paper Trading Simulation (T62)
Coder will create `simulate.py` to paper trade strategies using historical data and append PnL to the scoreboard. CLI arguments should specify strategy and capital allocation.

### 3. Risk Limits Configuration (T63)
Planner will design new config fields for per-strategy max risk. Synthesizer will update `Config` dataclass and docs. Tests ensure defaults are applied correctly.

### 4. Alert Aggregator Service (T64)
DataCollector will build a background process combining trade flow and news events into a unified alert queue, sending batched Slack messages.

These tasks will prepare the platform for real-world testing and more robust risk management.
