# Planning Notes - 2025-07-23

## Progress
- Added architecture overview describing proposed `collector` package.
- Established task list in `TASKS.md` for API key security, tests, configuration module, and modularization.

## Next Steps
1. Remove default API key and enforce presence of `POLYGON_API_KEY`.
2. Begin extracting functions into `collector/` package modules (`api.py`, `db.py`, `cli.py`, `stream.py`).
3. Implement argparse based configuration to handle symbol list, database path and real-time flag.
4. Write unit tests for `fetch_ohlcv` and `fetch_minute_bars` using mocked HTTP responses.
5. Introduce logging module and GitHub Actions CI as new tasks.

The architecture document should be refined as modules are implemented. Once the package layout stabilizes we will prepare packaging metadata (`pyproject.toml`) so the collector can be installed as a CLI tool.
