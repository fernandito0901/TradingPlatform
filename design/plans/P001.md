# Plan P001 - Numbered Migration

## Context
We currently organize planning notes by date under `design/YYYY-MM/`. This approach leads to inconsistent timestamps and clutter.

## Proposal
1. Consolidate existing dated plans into an archive document summarizing key milestones.
2. Adopt sequentially numbered plans under `design/plans/` starting with this file.
3. Maintain `PLAN_INDEX.md` until automation script (T41) generates a new numbered index.

## Tasks
- T47: Migrate dated plans to `planning/archive.md` and remove individual files.
- T48: Generate `plans/index.md` listing `P***` files in order.
- T49: Update README and docs to reference numbered plans.
