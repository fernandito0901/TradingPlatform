# Trading Dashboard Overview

The web dashboard automatically loads the latest model metrics, trade recommendations, and portfolio statistics. It is built with a responsive Bootstrap grid so sections collapse neatly on smaller screens.

## Layout
- **Left column**: recommended trades, latest news and watchlist symbols.
- **Center**: training metrics and the equity curve.
- **Right**: market overview prices and recent notifications.

Charts load lazily as you scroll to keep the page lightweight. Use the dark-mode toggle in the top navigation bar to switch themes.
