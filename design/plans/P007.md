# Planning Notes - P007

## Options Strategy Execution Framework

The next milestone is to implement multi-leg options strategies with built-in risk controls and probability-of-profit (POP) estimates.

### Goals
1. Support option strategy primitives such as iron condor and call debit spread.
2. Provide a POP estimator for arbitrary option legs.
3. Expose a strategy dashboard with buy/sell actions.
4. Enforce per-strategy risk limits via the unified `Config` dataclass.
5. Aggregate real-time trade flow and news alerts.

### Tasks
- **T57** – @Modeler implements payoff calculations for iron condor and call debit spread in `strategies.py` with unit tests.
- **T58** – @Synthesizer creates `reports/strategies.html` listing available strategies, POP values, and actions to execute via CLI.
- **T59** – @DataCollector extends async streaming to detect large trades and fetch breaking news; trigger Slack alerts during `run_daily`.
- **T60** – @Reviewer documents workflow for generating strategies, viewing the dashboard, and configuring alerts in the README.
- **T61** – @Modeler provides a Monte Carlo `strategies.pop` function returning POP between 0 and 1; tests cover simple positions.
- **T63** – @Synthesizer updates the `Config` dataclass with per-strategy `max_risk` fields and ensures defaults apply when not specified.
- **T64** – @DataCollector builds a background alert aggregator that batches trade and news events to Slack.

These steps will bring the project closer to a full-featured options trading assistant.
