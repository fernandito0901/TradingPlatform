# Planning Notes - 2025-08-08

## Restructure Summary
- Moved `features` and `models` packages to the project root.
- Added wrapper modules under `src/trading_platform` for backwards compatibility.
- Introduced project docs: `CODE_ATLAS.md`, `SCHEMAS.md`, `RUNBOOK.md`, `WORKFLOW.md`.

## Next Steps
1. Update tests to import the installed `trading_platform` package instead of manipulating `sys.path`.
2. Refresh README and design docs to explain the new package layout and wrappers.

These next steps are tracked in tasks T34 and T35.
