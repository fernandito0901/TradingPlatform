# Design Documents

This folder stores planning notes and architecture overviews maintained by the Planner.

Planning notes now live under `design/plans/` using a numeric sequence (`P001.md`, `P002.md`, ...).
Older date-based notes have been consolidated into `planning/archive.md`.

Architecture documents live in `design/architecture/` and are indexed by `ARCH_INDEX.md`.

See [PLAN_INDEX.md](PLAN_INDEX.md) for an ordered list of planning documents.
Regenerate the index with `python scripts/gen_plan_index.py`.
