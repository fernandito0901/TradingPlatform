# Planning Notes - 2025-07-28

## Progress
Feature engineering (T13) and baseline model training (T14) are finished, enabling us to start producing trade ideas.

## Next Goals
1. **News Data Collection** – Extend `collector.api` with a `fetch_news` function that queries NewsAPI for the latest articles per symbol. Store results in a new `news` table and document the schema in `db.py`.
2. **Volatility Features** – Add implied and historical volatility features (`iv30`, `hv30`) and a GARCH sigma estimate to the feature pipeline. Tests should confirm the new columns.
3. **Model Validation** – Update `models.train` to perform a train/test split and return AUC for both sets.
4. **Playbook Generation** – Create a `playbook/` package that loads model predictions, applies the scoring rule and outputs `playbooks/{date}.json`.

These tasks will unlock end‑to‑end playbook generation for the Synthesizer.
