# Current State Analysis
- The repo contains a single Python script `market_data_collector.py` used to fetch historical OHLCV data, minute bars, real-time quotes, option chains, fundamentals, corporate actions, SMA indicators, and provides optional streaming via Polygon's websockets.
- Data is stored in a local SQLite database `market_data.db`.
- Dependencies include `requests` and `websocket-client`.
- No test suite, CI or additional modules exist.
- The API key is defaulted to a specific value which may expose credentials.

# Proposed Next Steps
1. **Secure API Keys**
   - Remove the hard-coded fallback key and require `POLYGON_API_KEY` to be set.
   - Document key loading in README.
2. **Basic Test Coverage**
   - Add pytest-based unit tests for `fetch_ohlcv`, `fetch_minute_bars` and websocket subscription logic using mocked responses.
3. **Configuration Module**
   - Introduce a small module to handle command line arguments and configuration (symbols list, DB file path, real-time flag).
4. **Task Tracking**
   - Create `TASKS.md` listing open tasks with IDs, titles, acceptance criteria and assigned roles as per `AGENTS.md`.
