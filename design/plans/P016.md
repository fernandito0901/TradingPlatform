# Planning Notes - P016

## Polygon Integration for 15-Minute Delayed Feed

The web dashboard should automatically start pulling delayed quotes from Polygon when launched so that users immediately see trade ideas while the model trains. Existing collectors fetch daily and minute data on demand but the interface does not display live updates until the pipeline finishes. This plan introduces a background service that streams the 15 minute delayed feed and pipes each update to the dashboard.

### Goals
1. Stream the `delayed` Polygon WebSocket feed for configured symbols.
2. Append incoming quotes to `market_data.db` and broadcast to clients.
3. Trigger feature pipeline and model training after enough data is gathered.
4. Display top trade recommendations live while training continues in the background.

### Tasks
- **T101** – @Planner describe delayed feed architecture and config options.
- **T102** – @Coder implement `collector/delayed_stream.py` consuming the feed and writing quotes to SQLite.
- **T103** – @Synthesizer connect delayed stream to the training pipeline and update the webapp to display live recommendations.
- **T104** – @Tester add tests for delayed stream handling and automatic pipeline start.
- **T105** – @Reviewer verify documentation and functionality for the delayed feed integration.
