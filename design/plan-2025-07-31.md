# Planning Notes - 2025-07-31

## Progress
- NewsAPI integration (T12) completed with headlines saved under `news` table.
- README updated with environment variable docs and logging options (T9).
- WebSocket reconnection tests merged (T10).
- Playbook generation verified (T15) and sample JSON produced.

## Next Steps
1. **Volatility Features (T16)** – Extend the feature pipeline to compute `iv30`, `hv30` and `garch_sigma`. Unit tests should confirm these columns.
2. **Model Validation (T17)** – Update `models.train` to perform a train/test split and output AUC for both sets.
3. **News Sentiment (T18)** – Derive a daily `news_sent` score from collected headlines using a sentiment analyzer and add it to `features.csv`.
4. **Scoring Rule Update (T19)** – Incorporate `news_sent`, `IV_edge`, `UOA` and `garch_spike` into the playbook scoring logic with accompanying tests.
5. **Daily Orchestration (T20)** – Provide a script that chains data collection, feature engineering, model retraining and playbook creation so the whole pipeline can run unattended.

These steps bring the system closer to a fully automated daily options playbook.
