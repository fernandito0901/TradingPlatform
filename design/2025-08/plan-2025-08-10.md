# Planning Notes - 2025-08-10

## Follow-up on Documentation Restructure
- All existing planning notes are now organized by month with `design/YYYY-MM/` directories.
- Headers match their filenames, but maintaining the index manually is error-prone.

## Next Steps
1. **Automate PLAN_INDEX updates (T41)** – Create a small script that scans `design/*/plan-*.md` and rewrites `PLAN_INDEX.md` in chronological order.
2. **Add header/file consistency check (T42)** – Validate that each plan's heading matches its filename; fail CI if mismatched.
3. **Version architecture docs (T43)** – Move `architecture-*.md` files into a new `design/architecture/` folder with their own index.

These tasks will keep documentation tidy as the project grows.
