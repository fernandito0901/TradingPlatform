# Planning Notes - 2025-07-29

## Progress
- Completed playbook generation (T15) with unit tests and sample output.
- Feature pipeline (T13) and baseline model training (T14) now validated.
- HTTP caching layer (T11) operational.

## Upcoming Tasks
1. **Environment Docs** – Expand README with a configuration section covering `POLYGON_API_KEY`, `CACHE_TTL` and logging options (T9).
2. **WebSocket Tests** – Mock `stream_quotes` to verify reconnect logic on unauthorized errors (T10).
3. **News Data Collection** – Implement `fetch_news` in `collector.api` saving articles to a new `news` table (T12).
4. **Volatility Features** – Add `iv30`, `hv30` and `garch_sigma` to the feature pipeline with tests (T16).
5. **Model Validation** – Update `models.train` to return train/test AUC metrics (T17).

These tasks advance data coverage and modeling quality for daily playbook generation.
