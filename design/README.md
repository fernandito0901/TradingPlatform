# Design Documents

This folder stores planning notes and high-level architecture overviews used by the project Planner.
Planning notes are currently grouped into monthly folders named `YYYY-MM`. We have begun migrating to a numbered format (`P001.md`, `P002.md`) under `design/plans/` to avoid date inconsistencies.
Architecture overviews live at the root of this folder as `architecture-YYYY-MM-DD.md` files. They will move to an `architecture/` subfolder once task T43 is completed.
See [PLAN_INDEX.md](PLAN_INDEX.md) for older dated plans and [plans/index.md](plans/index.md) for new numbered notes.
