# Planning Notes - P003

## Roadmap for Async Pipeline and Metrics

1. **Async Collector API (T47)**
   - @Coder will build `collector/api_async.py` using `aiohttp`.
   - Replace blocking calls in `run_daily` when `--async` flag is set.
   - Tester to add unit tests for success and failure paths.

2. **Cross-Validation Training (T48)**
   - @Modeler extends `models.train` with a 5-fold CV mode.
   - Save per-fold AUC scores to `reports/dashboard.html`.

3. **Interactive Feature Dashboard (T49)**
   - @Synthesizer creates Plotly report `reports/feature_dashboard.html`.
   - Document usage in README under Reports.

4. **Environment File Loader (T50)**
   - @Coder implements `load_env()` reading `.env` if present.
   - All CLI entry points import and call this function at startup.

### New Tasks

5. **Async Streaming Module (T51)**
   - @Coder: create `collector/stream_async.py` using websockets for concurrent price streams.
   - Integrate with async API from T47.

6. **Trade Scoreboard (T52)**
   - @Modeler: track historical playbook performance in `reports/scoreboard.csv`.
   - Add function to append daily results after playbook execution.

7. **Unified Config Dataclass (T53)**
   - @Synthesizer: provide a dataclass capturing CLI and env options.
   - Update modules to accept a Config object instead of raw args.

These tasks will prepare the pipeline for scalable async execution and better monitoring.
