# Planning Notes - 2025-08-09

## Observations
- Package restructure complete; tests run through installed package.
- Early architecture doc references outdated module layout.
- Planning notes accumulate in flat folder making navigation harder.

## Action Items
1. **Update architecture overview (T38)** – Document new root packages (`features`, `models`) and wrapper modules. Update diagrams if any.
2. **Organize plans by month (T39)** – Move notes into `design/2025-*/` directories and update `PLAN_INDEX.md`.
3. **Clean up TASKS.md (T40)** – Remove redundant "Planned Tasks" section and ensure open tasks are unique.

These tasks should streamline future planning and keep documentation consistent.
